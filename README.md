Custom-Resent model

**Introduction**

The goal of this project is impelement custome resenet model on the CIFAR10 datset using pytorch.this projects demonstrates how to develop Resnet architecture,data agumentation statergies, custom dataset classes, and learning rate schedulers.

**Methodology**

 The project is organized as follows: 
 
 1.Data Loading and Preprocessing

 2.Dataset statistics calcualtion

 3.Data Agumentation statergy 

 4.Development of Model
 
 5.Performance of the Developed model


** Data Loading and Preprocessing**
