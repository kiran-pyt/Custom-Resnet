Custom-Resent model

**Introduction**

The goal of this project is impelement custome resenet model on the CIFAR10 datset using pytorch.this projects demonstrates how to develop Resnet architecture,data agumentation statergies, custom dataset classes, and learning rate schedulers.

**Methodology**

 The project is organized as follows: 
 
 1.Data Loading and Preprocessing

 2.Dataset statistics calcualtion

 3.Data Agumentation statergy 

 4.Development of Model
 
 5.Performance of the Developed model

 **Data Loading and Preprocessing**

 In the fields of machine learning and computer vision, the CIFAR-10 dataset is considered a benchmark dataset due to its widespread use.CIFAR-10 is utilised in a large number of research publications and projects in order to evaluate and compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms and neural network designs.It is a widely used dataset for research into novel computer vision techniques as well as their development.If you would like to learn more about cfar10, please click the link below.

On the train dataset, we applied the normalisation, padding, random cutting, and horizontal flipping data argumentation strategies.These mentioned strategies are implemented from the albumentations library.
