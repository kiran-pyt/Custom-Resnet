X = Conv 3x3 (s1, p1) >> MaxPool2D >> BN >> RELU [512k]
R2 = ResBlock( (Conv-BN-ReLU-Conv-BN-ReLU))(X) [512k]
Add(X, R2)
MaxPooling with Kernel Size 4
FC Layer 
SoftMax
Uses One Cycle Policy such that:
Total Epochs = 24
Max at Epoch = 5
LRMIN = FIND
LRMAX = FIND
NO Annihilation
Uses this transform -RandomCrop 32, 32 (after padding of 4) >> FlipLR >> Followed by CutOut(8, 8)
Batch size = 512
Use ADAM, and CrossEntropyLoss
Target Accuracy: 90%
NO score if your code is not modular. Your collab must be importing your GitHub package, and then just running the model. I should be able to find the custom_resnet.py model in your GitHub repo that you'd be training. 
Once done, proceed to answer the Assignment-Solution page.
